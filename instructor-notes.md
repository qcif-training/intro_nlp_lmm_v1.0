# Enhanced Workshop Report: Recommendations and Insights

As we complete the first version of the "Natural Language Processing for Research" workshop, it is imperative to reflect on the content feedback to identify areas for improvement. This report combines the recommendations from the workshop creator with insights gleaned from our extensive dialogue.

### Extended Workshop Duration: 
Allocate at least two full days for the workshop. This extension will provide sufficient time for in-depth exploration of topics and ensure a more relaxed pace for learning and interaction. A longer duration will also allow for the inclusion of more advanced topics such as RAG, which we identified as crucial for researchers aiming to apply NLP tools more independently.

### Hands-on Coding Practice:
Incorporate more hands-on coding exercises, especially in the "Domain-specific LLMs" episode. Practical application is key to reinforcing complex concepts and building confidence in implementation. Our discussions highlighted the importance of live coding and real-time problem-solving, which can be effectively integrated into these sessions.

### Data Extraction Episode:
**Recommendation:** Introduce a new episode focused on extracting data from scientific and open-source databases. This skill is important for any NLP project and will greatly benefit researchers. Ensuring researchers know how to gather and preprocess data is as important as understanding the NLP models themselves.

### Custom Visual Aids:
Develop more original charts and diagrams that are creative, informative, and tailored to the workshop content. Some charts and shapes are sourced from external resources that could be less clear and irrelevant. We need more custom visuals which will enhance understanding and engagement.

### Concept Definitions and Mathematical Expressions:
Revisit episodes like "Transformers for NLP" to include fundamental information without overwhelming learners. Creating supplementary materials could address this need. For instance, in the “Transformers for NLP” episode, we did not include enough fundamental information about ANNs and Transformers to keep the episode concise. However, this could pose challenges for learners who are completely new to machine learning and neural networks. Our chat underscored the necessity of balancing technical depth with accessibility, especially for participants new to machine learning and neural networks.

### Advanced NLP Tools and Techniques:
Plan subsequent workshops to cover advanced NLP tools. Researchers require deeper NLP knowledge to conduct NLP tasks independently in their specific domains. The progression from basic to advanced tools should be gradual and well-structured, as we have established the importance of building a strong foundational understanding first.

### Foundation of NLP:
Maintain coverage of foundational NLP frameworks and tools. Although some of the frameworks, and tools covered in the first part of the workshop may seem outdated, we believe it is essential for understanding the evolution of NLP. It helps learners better understand the underlying mechanisms of NLP and its applications at higher levels, enabling them to build the skill sets needed for their specific field of research.
