## 1.1. Introduction to NLP Workshop

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is becoming a popular and robust tool for a wide range of research projects. In this episode we embark on a journey to explore the transformative power of NLP tools in the realm of research. 

It is tailored for researchers who are keen on harnessing the capabilities of NLP to enhance and expedite their work. Whether you are delving into text classification, extracting pivotal information, discerning sentiments, summarizing extensive documents, translating across languages, or developing sophisticated question-answering systems, this session will lay the foundational knowledge you need to leverage NLP effectively.

We will begin by delving into the **Common Applications of NLP in Research**, showcasing how these tools are not just theoretical concepts but practical instruments that drive forward today’s innovative research projects. From analyzing public sentiment to extracting critical data from a plethora of documents, NLP stands as a pillar in the modern researcher’s toolkit.

Next, we’ll demystify the **Basic Concepts and Terminology of NLP**. Understanding these fundamental terms is crucial, as they form the building blocks of any NLP application. We’ll cover everything from the basics of a corpus to the intricacies of transformers, ensuring you have a solid grasp of the language used in NLP. 

Finally, we’ll guide you through Data Acquisition: Dataset Libraries, where you’ll learn about the treasure troves of data available at your fingertips. We’ll compare different libraries and demonstrate how to access and utilize these resources through hands-on examples. 

By the end of this episode, you will not only understand the significance of NLP in research but also be equipped with the knowledge to start applying these tools to your own projects. Prepare to unlock new potentials and streamline your research process with the power of NLP!


## 1.2.	Common Applications of NLP in Research

**Sentiment Analysis** is a powerful tool for researchers, especially in fields like market research, political science, and public health. It involves the computational identification of opinions expressed in text, categorizing them as positive, negative, or neutral. In market research, for instance, sentiment analysis can be applied to product reviews to gauge consumer satisfaction: a study could analyze thousands of online reviews for a new smartphone model to determine the overall public sentiment. This can help companies identify areas of improvement or features that are well-received by consumers. 



**Information Extraction** is crucial for quickly gathering specific information from large datasets. It is used extensively in legal research, medical research, and scientific studies to extract entities and relationships from texts. In legal research, for example, information extraction can be used to sift through case law to find precedents related to a particular legal issue. A researcher could use NLP to extract instances of “negligence” from thousands of case files, aiding in the preparation of legal arguments. 



**Text Summarization** helps researchers by providing concise summaries of lengthy documents, such as research papers or reports, allowing them to quickly understand the main points without reading the entire text. In biomedical research, text summarization can assist in literature reviews by providing summaries of research articles. For example, a researcher could use an NLP model to summarize articles on gene therapy, enabling them to quickly assimilate key findings from a vast array of publications.



**Topic Modeling** is used to uncover latent topics within large volumes of text, which is particularly useful in fields like sociology and history to identify trends and patterns in historical documents or social media data.

For example, in historical research, topic modeling can reveal prevalent themes in primary source documents from a particular era. A historian might use NLP to analyze newspapers from the early 20th century to study public discourse around significant events like World War I.


**Named Entity Recognition** is a process where an algorithm takes a string of text (sentence or paragraph) and identifies relevant nouns (people, places, and organizations) that are mentioned in that string. NER is used in many fields in NLP, and it can help answer many real-world questions, such as: Which companies were mentioned in the news article? Were specified products mentioned in complaints or reviews? Does the tweet (recently rebranded to X) contain the name of a person? Does the tweet contain this person’s location?

### Challenges of NLP

One of the significant challenges in NLP is dealing with the ambiguity of language. Words or phrases can have multiple meanings, and determining the correct one based on context can be difficult for NLP systems. In a research paper discussing “bank erosion,” an NLP system might confuse “bank” with a financial institution rather than the geographical feature, leading to incorrect analysis. 

**This challenge leads to the fact that the classical NLP systems often struggle with contextual understanding which is crucial in text analysis tasks.** This can lead to misinterpretation of the meaning and sentiment of the text. If a research paper mentions “novel results,” an NLP system might interpret “novel” as a literary work instead of “new” or “original,” which could mislead the analysis of the paper’s contributions.

- Image datasets can be found online or created uniquely for your research question.
- Images consist of pixels arranged in a particular order.
- Image data is usually preprocessed before use in a CNN for efficiency, consistency, and robustness.
- Input data generally consists of three sets: a training set used to fit model parameters; a validation set used to evaluate the model fit on training data; and a test set used to evaluate the final model performance.
